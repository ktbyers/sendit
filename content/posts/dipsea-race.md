Dipsea Explained
----------------
The Dipsea Race is a 7.1 mile (mostly) trail race that starts in Mill Valley, CA and ends at the Pacific Ocean in Stinson Beach. My watch put the elevation gain at 2100 feet.

It consists of essentially two big hills&mdash;the first seven hundred feet climb out of Mill Valley to Panaromic Highway and then the second twelve-hundred feet climb from Muir Woods to the top of a hill known as Cardiac Hill.

The Dipsea Race has a few quirks&mdash;first it is an age and gender handicapped race. This meant for me, as a fifty-one year old that I got a six-minute handicap. Yes, I am in the same grouping as thirteen year-olds.

This is accomplished by having a handicapped start with the oldest people starting first and the scratch runners starting last.

To further complicate this, there are two sections&mdash;the invitational section and the standard section. The invitational section goes first in age and gender adjusted waves. After all of the invitational section goes, then the standard section goes.

Once again the standard section starts in age and gender adjusted waves.

The net-effect of all this is that is a mad-house of constantly passing people and of constantly being passed.

One other Dipsea quirk is that there are two officially sanctioned short-cuts (Swoop and Suicide). There used to be a third short-cut whereby the Moors would be bypassed, but this shortcut was not allowed in 2021 nor in 2022. I wasn't too disappointed by this as I like the Moors quite a bit.


Race Start
----------
The race start felt fine. I took off up the road out of Mill Valley; I tried to go at a good pace, but not crazy. It is maybe a third of a mile to where the stairs start.


Mill Valley Stairs
------------------
The stairs are very crowded. They will always be very crowded in this race. It was not too difficult to pass on the left, but I ended up walking up the vast majority of them. 

I probably should strategize on how to do the stairs faster and learn what is optimal for hiking up stairs (some sort of power hiking). There is a rail that you can grab so you can engage your upper body a bit to help pull yourself a long. I did a certain amount of this.

I should have kept a better eye on my heart rate on the stairs&mdash;it is very easy to let it get too high here. My heart rate was higher than I liked on the first set of stairs (hit 165 which is a bit above LT). I had my heart rate more where I wanted on the last set of stairs, but still pretty high (average 158).

I did pretty well from the top of the stairs to crossing Panaromic Highway, average heart rate of 154 (which is pretty much where I wanted to be) and average grade-adjusted pace of 7:30. I crossed Panoramic Highway at 14:48 (1.2 miles and +690 ft in elevation).


Crusing Down to Muir Woods
--------------------------
This section is fast. I ran this section in 7:07. It is about nine-tenths of a mile with -620 in elevation. Roughly half of this section is on the Muir Woods road which is downhill and wide so the other people don't matter.

Suicide shortcut is easy and short so I don't know what the fuss is all about.

It took me 22:24 from the race-start to get to Muir Creek which is pretty much where I wanted to be.


Going up Dynamite
-----------------
Now is when the race really started.

Dynamite was crowded and steep. Once again a lot of stairs and I could use practice on power hiking.

I generally was hiking, but would opportunistically run when I needed to pass people.

Once again I should have watched my heart rate a bit closer&mdash;too much time over 160 here. It took me 5:39 to do the section from the creek to Deer Park Fire Road. Grade adjusted pace of 7:23.


Hogsback
--------
This was probably the section of the race where I did the best. I tried to temper my heart rate a bit here. My average heart rate from when I hit Deer Park Fire Road to the top of Cardiac was 153 and my grade adjusted pace was 9:03 (which in retrospect is not very good).

I kept a good steady pace. It is steep, but runnable. I ran up all of this excluding the very steep part right near the top of Cardiac. 

This was the first stretch of the race that was out in the sun. It was still pretty cool (maybe lower sixties), but I definitely started noticing the heat here.


Cardiac
-------
I am only referring to the last fifth of a mile right before the very top here.

I pretty much walked up all of this. It is very steep and rocky with lots of tree roots. I didn't want to blow up here. This fifth of a mile took me 3:33 with a 10:36 grade adjusted pace.

I reached the top of Cardiac at 51:35.


All Downhill from Here (almost)
-------------------------------
![Downhill from Cardiac](/img/dipsea_between_cardiac_and_swoop.jpg)

The main water station is at the very top of Cardiac. I grabbed a drink of water and threw the rest over my head.

I ran a 7:04 from Cardiac to Swoop (grade-adjusted pace at 8:23). I was booking pretty well and doing a good job of keeping my cadence high. It is a bit challenging to run some of this fast.



Swoop
-----
Swoop is where I blew up. Not sure what happened here.

My heart rate went pretty high. It jumped up to 176 here (peak).

My guess is I just got to about an hour of very hard running and had reached the level of stress my body could handle in a reasonable way.

I slowed down a bit going down Swoop.

My heart rate was pretty elevated all the way down Swoop&mdash;average heart rate of 167. I would not have said I was going all that hard right here (i.e. heart rate was higher than I would have expected for the given pace).


Down the Steep Ravine Stairs
----------------------------

These stairs are crazy steep and one could definitely fall in a not so pleasant way here.

I did pretty well on these stairs. It wasn't super crowded, but there were a few people. I wanted to be not too aggressive here. If you screw up here, you have a good chance of being done for the day.

I ran down the stairs in 2:43. My best in training was 2:06. I practiced these quite a bit.


Insult Hill
-----------

I really didn't have anything left in the tank going up Insult Hill and thought it was not a good idea to try to run up as it would burn me for running through the Moors.

Got to the top of Insult hill and then started to try to crank it up a bit.


The Moors
---------
![Downhill from Cardiac](/img/dipsea_moors.jpg)

Hardly anything left to run through the Moors. I ran them, but I wasn't fast. This was probably the section of the race that I was most disappointed about.

I had to walk up the (very) small hill in the middle of the Moors. Once again I thought power walking up this was the best so I could run reasonably well after that. I was definitely very gassed for this entire section.

I definitely lost time in from Insult Hill to the finish line.

I did reasonably well on the last set of stairs after the Moors.


Final stretch
-------------
I did reasonably well here. There wasn't hardly anything left in the tank.

That's it.


Goal #1: Qualify for Invitational Section in 2023.
-------

Looks like I probably missed this by about a minute and ten seconds. 

There is a bit of a Dipsea statistical quirk here due to the number of invitational runners in this year's race. I ended up finishing about 406th overall (age-adjusted), but I will miss out on the invitational section. Or worded differently, I was faster than about fifty of the top-450 invitational runners.

It is a bit of Dipsea quirk, but it is what it is.

It also probably implies that the 2023 invitational section will be much easier to qualify for (since there will be significantly fewer invitational runners in 2023. Once again a Dipsea quirk.


Goal #2 - 1:17:30
-------

I doubt I was going to hit this time. 

I probably could have marginally improved my time if I had controlled my heart rate more coming out of Mill Valley and on Dynamite.

I definitely lost time from the bottom of the Steep Ravine Stairs to the finish line, but I doubt I would have made up 90 seconds on this section.


Goal #3 - 1:12:30 (or something thereabouts)
-------

Definitely wasn't happening given my current fitness and running efficiency.


Dipsea Results Page
-------------------

[Results Page](https://www.dipsea.org/2022/2022prelim.html)


The Dipsea results are a bit confusing due to the age and gender handicapped starts and the two sections (invitational and regular).

You can translate my results into 1:13:07 (age adjusted time). My actual clock time was 1:19:07 with a handicap adjustment of minus-6 minutes.
