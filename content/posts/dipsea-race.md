Dipsea Explained
----------------
The Dipsea Race is a 7.1 mile (mostly) trail race that starts in Mill Valley, CA and ends at the Pacific Ocean in Stinson Beach. It has about 2200 feet in elevation gain.

The race consists of two big hills. The first hill is a seven-hundred foot climb out of Mill Valley featuring three long, and unpleasant, stair-cases with about seven-hundred stairs total. The second hill is a roughly twelve-hundred foot climb from Muir Woods to the top of Cardiac Hill. This section has its own unpleasant stairs in the section named Dynamite.

The Dipsea Race has a few quirks&mdash;first it is an age and gender handicapped race. This meant for me, a fifty-one year old, that I received a six-minute handicap and was grouped, yes, with the thirteen year-olds. Age spares no one.

This handicapping is accomplished by starting the race in waves with the oldest and youngest starting first and eventually, twenty-five minutes later, the scratch men start. In between these two end-points, there are twenty-four other groups of men and women of varying ages.

The first to cross the finish line wins&mdash;whether it be a twelve year old girl, a twenty-four year old man, or a seventy year old woman.

To further complicate the race, there are two sections&mdash;the invitational section and the standard section. All the waves of the invitational section go first and after these,  the process repeats itself with another twenty-six waves in the standard section. 

The net-effect of all this is&mdash;a mad-house of constantly passing and of constantly being passed.

One other Dipsea quirk is that there are two officially sanctioned short-cuts (Swoop and Suicide). Historically, the race used to be start at point A and run to point B on any route you could find and the first one to the finish line won. This has been whittled down to only two remaining shortcuts (well technically three if you still count the Moors bypass, but that short-cut was barred in both 2021 and 2022).

Race Start
----------
The race start felt fine. I took off up the road out of Mill Valley; I tried to go at a good pace, but not crazy. It is maybe a third of a mile to where the Dipsea Stairs start.


Dipsea Stairs
-------------
![Mill Valley Stairs](/img/mill_valley_stairs.jpg)

#### All we have to fear is fear itself...well that, and the Dipsea Stairs.

The stairs are very crowded. 

In this race, they will (almost) always be very crowded. It was not too difficult to pass on the left, but I ended up walking up the vast majority of the stairs.

I need to strategize on how to do the stairs faster and learn an improved hiking strategy (some sort of power hiking). There is also a rail that you can grab so you can engage your upper body and help pull yourself along. I did a certain amount of this.

I also should have kept a better eye on my heart rate here&mdash;it is very easy to let your heart rate get too high in this section. I went above my lactate threshold heart-rate for a bit which was probably not a good idea this early in the race.

After the stairs, there still is another half mile climb up to the ridge and another three hundred feet of elevation gain. I did pretty well on this section and crossed Panaromic Highway at 14:48 (1.2 miles in and +690 feet in elevation).


Crusing Down to Muir Woods
--------------------------
This section is fast. I ran it in 7:07 (and the road sub-section at a 6:10 pace). It is about nine-tenths of a mile with -620 in elevation loss. Roughly half of this section is on the Muir Woods road which is downhill and wide so all the other people don't matter much.

Suicide shortcut is easy and short so I don't know what the all the fuss is about.

It took me about 22:30 from the race-start to get to Muir Creek which is pretty much where I wanted to be.


Going up Dynamite
-----------------
Now is when the race really started.

Dynamite was crowded and steep. Once again a lot of stairs and once again I could use practice on power hiking.

I generally was hiking, but would opportunistically run when I needed to pass people.

Once again I should have watched my heart rate a bit closer&mdash;too much time over lactate threshold heartrate here. It took me 5:39 to do the section from the creek to Deer Park Fire Road. Grade adjusted pace of 7:23.


Hogsback
--------
I tried to temper my heart rate a bit on this section (as I was worried about blowing up). My average heart rate from when I hit Deer Park Fire Road to the top of Cardiac was 153 and my grade adjusted pace was 9:03 (which in retrospect is not very good).

I tried to keep a good steady pace. It is steep, but runnable. I ran up all of this section.

This was the first stretch of the race that was out in the sun. It was still pretty cool (maybe lower sixties), but I definitely started noticing the heat here.


Cardiac
-------
I am only referring to the last fifth of a mile right before the very top here.

I pretty much walked up all of this. It is very steep and rocky with lots of tree roots. Once again, I didn't want to blow up on this section. This fifth of a mile took me 3:33 with a 10:36 grade adjusted pace.

I reached the top of Cardiac at 51:35.


All Downhill from Here (almost)
-------------------------------
![Downhill from Cardiac](/img/dipsea_between_cardiac_and_swoop.jpg)

The main water station is at the very top of Cardiac. I grabbed a drink of water and threw the rest over my head.

I ran a 7:04 from Cardiac to Swoop (grade-adjusted pace of 8:23). I was booking pretty well and doing a good job of keeping my cadence high. This is one of the faster sections of the race.


Swoop
-----
#### All hell done broke loose now!

Swoop is where I blew up. 

Not entirely sure what happened. My heart rate went pretty high. It jumped up to 176 peak (way above my lactate threshold heart rate).

My guess is I got to about an hour of very hard running and had reached the level of stress my body could handle in a reasonable way.

I slowed down a bit going down Swoop.

My heart rate was pretty elevated all the way down Swoop&mdash;average heart rate of 167. I would not have said I was going all that hard right here (i.e. heart rate was higher than I would have expected for the given pace).


Down the Steep Ravine Stairs
----------------------------

![Dipsea Stairs](/img/dipsea_stairs.jpg)

These stairs are crazy steep and one could definitely fall in an unpleasant way here.

I did pretty well on these stairs. It wasn't super crowded, but there were a few people. I wanted to be not too aggressive here. If you screw up here, you have a good chance of being done for the day.

I ran down the stairs in 2:43. My best time in training was 2:06. I practiced these stairs quite a bit.


Insult Hill
-----------

I really didn't have much left in the tank going up Insult Hill and thought it was not a good idea to try to run up as it would burn me for running through the Moors.

Got to the top of Insult hill and then started to try to crank it up a bit.


The Moors
---------
![Downhill from Cardiac](/img/dipsea_moors.jpg)

Hardly anything left to run through the Moors. I ran them, but I wasn't fast. This was the section of the race that I was most disappointed about.

I had to walk up the (very) small hill in the middle of the Moors. Once again I thought power walking up this was the best so I could run reasonably well after that. I was definitely very gassed for this entire section.

I definitely lost time from Insult Hill to the finish line.

I did reasonably well on the last set of stairs after the Moors.


Final stretch
-------------
I did reasonably well here. There wasn't hardly anything left in the tank though.


Goal #1: Qualify for Invitational Section in 2023.
-------

Looks like I probably missed this by about a minute and ten seconds. 

There is a bit of a Dipsea statistical quirk here due to the large number of invitational runners in this year's race. I ended up placing about 405 with respect to the invitational runners. Or in other words, faster than about fifty of the people that will get invites in 2023 (age and gender adjusted).

It is a bit of Dipsea quirk, but it is what it is.

It also probably implies that the 2023 invitational section will be much easier to qualify for (since there will be significantly fewer invitational runners in 2023).


Goal #2 - 1:17:30
-------

I doubt I was going to hit this time. 

I probably could have marginally improved my time if I had controlled my heart rate more coming out of Mill Valley and on Dynamite.

I definitely lost time from the bottom of the Steep Ravine Stairs to the finish line, but I doubt I would have made up 90 seconds on this section.


Goal #3 - 1:12:30 (or something thereabouts)
-------

Definitely wasn't happening given my current fitness and running efficiency.


Dipsea Results Page
-------------------

[Results Page](https://www.dipsea.org/2022/2022prelim.html)

The Dipsea results are a bit confusing due to the age and gender handicapped starts and the two sections (invitational and regular).

You can translate my results into 1:13:07 (age adjusted time). My actual clock time was 1:19:07 with a handicap adjustment of minus-6 minutes.

See you next year...hopefully.
